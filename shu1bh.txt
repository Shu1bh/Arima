My leadership skills have positively influenced the team and contributed to the success of these projects.

Embracing Diversity:

By valuing the unique perspectives and skills of team members, we have fostered an inclusive environment that promotes creativity and innovation. In the forecasting of deposits at the UPID level and generating insights for nostro accounts in LQM, I sought input from colleagues with different backgrounds, which allowed us to approach challenges from various angles and achieve comprehensive results. Embracing diversity has enriched our work and led to more effective solutions.
